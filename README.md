## 🔧 Project Structure

This repository organizes solutions by day and uses tests to validate solutions for both parts of each day's challenge.

```plaintext
📁 advent-of-code-2024
├── 📁 day-1/           # Solutions for Day 1
│   ├── src/test/java   # Tests for Part One and Part Two
│   └── ...
├── 📁 day-2/           # Solutions for Day 2
│   ├── src/test/java   # Tests for Part One and Part Two
│   └── ...
├── 📁 day-3/           # Solutions for Day 3
│   ├── src/test/java   # Tests for Part One and Part Two
│   └── ...
├── 📁 domain/          # Common utilities and shared code
│   ├── src/main/java   # Reusable components (e.g., input parsers, helpers)
│   └── ...
└── README.md           # You're here!
``` 

Each day’s solutions are verified using tests:
-	PartOneTest validates the solution for Part 1 of the puzzle.
-	PartTwoTest validates the solution for Part 2 of the puzzle.

This structure keeps solutions clean, modular, and testable.
